- Los Angeles has been using a predictive algorithm for over 20 years.
- We should keep that in mind when listening to claims about how a new, more high tech predictive algorithm will help transform the system.]

- AURA = Approach to Understanding Risk Assessment
- An automated tool, developed by SAS, a private company.
- The pilot was developed in 2014, and used only on historical data, not real cases.
- Assessment from a 2017 Office of Child Protection Report:
  > "While the tool correctly detected a high number of children (171 cases) at the highest risk for abuse, it also incorrectly identified an extremely high number (3,829 cases) of false positives (i.e., children who received high risk scores who were not at risk for a negative outcome). [...] DCFS is no longer pursuing Project AURA."

## Overview of the Risk Stratification Model (RSM)
  The program has three parts:
- Uses historical DCFS data to make predictions.
- Identifies about 10% of DCFS cases as **complex-risk**.
- Presents information on **complex-risk** cases to supervisors.

  ###What Does DCFS Data Include?
  The tool developers emphasize that the **RSM** is different from the other tool they worked on, the **AFST**. While the **AFST** uses public records from multiple county agencies, the **RSM** only uses data from California's Child Welfare database (**CWS/CMS**).

  ##How will DCFS use the tool?]
  .right-column[
- Unlike **AFST** or **SDM**, the **RSM** tool doesn't suggest a decision to a caseworker.
- The **RSM** is meant to tell caseworkers to focus supervision on high risk cases or to transfer those cases to the most experienced caseworkers.]

- DCFS and CDN have also said that the tool can help reduce racial bias. They say the tool can lead to:
> "Deep dive review to help identify whether many of these reports could have been (or should have been) screened out."
[...]
"Regional office review of potential community service needs, mandated reporter training that could address disparities."  
[...]
"Possible alternative investigation protocols initiated with community partners for low-complexity reports."

#Questions
- Will a caregiver be told when an investigation is marked "complex-risk?"
- When caseworkers request data from other agencies, does that affect the risk score? Could that add racial bias?
- What are supervisors supposed to do for "complex-risk" families?
  - Do they have additional services and resources that would be helpful?
  - If so, why do those services need to come through DCFS?
---
#Next steps
- Possibly meeting with Jennie Feria, a lead on the project at DCFS.
- Submitting new PRA requests with more specific questions about the data that the tool uses and/or results from the initial pilot.
